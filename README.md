# Figma your Life

Make a Figma about your life. 

You will create a prototype of a website about your life and be functional 

(If you are not comfortable with putting out personal information create one about an influential person)

This will be a multipage style figma with multiple pages  

- minimum 3 pages 
- landing page
- interests page
- accomplishments page
- use Bootstrap
- Figma and GH Repo links in comments

Figma has to be approved before you can start with your coding
